##Error Checking and Testing { #testing  .tabset .tabset-fade}

Error checking and testing is risk based:

Questions that need resolved for this process:

* What is/are the best packages for TBDS: 
    + sinytest, testthat, validate?, vitrite? (jh, I don't know what this is)
* How often should we formally test?

<br>

###Initial Proposal:

####Guiding Principles:

* Testing should focus on only what changed
* Adjacent areas that could be affected by change should be tested
* 

####Testing Plan:

1. **New Deployment of Application of Major Section:**
    + Comprehensive testing using error checking packages
2. **Data Update:**
    + If DB is updated: verify new date range is active in SQL Server
    + Verify that all final dataframes/data sets have the new date range active 
    + Run all transfomation scripts
    + Run the application/medium
    + Verify that all visuals are populated using the new date range
3. **Section Edit:**
    + Use *testthat* package to test new functions
    + Run the application/medium
    + Verify that new section is working (i.e. visuals are rendered, no overlapping material)
    + Click through all areas of the medium and verify there are no obvious negative effects (e.g. html code interactions)
