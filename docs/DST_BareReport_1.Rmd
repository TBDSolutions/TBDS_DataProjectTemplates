##Modeling, Visualization and Analysis

The modeling and visualization elements are developed and maintained in the data medium determined in the *project charter*.  The following methodology is applied:

*	Document key variables derived from source dataset in the [data dictionary](#data_dict) (copy from DSR_Framework if needed).
*	Evaluate algorithms or statistical models developed (as necessary)
*	Develop visualizations and additional output, as defined
*	Draft report / output and review with Project Sponsor and Project Manager

OutType <- OutList[1]
if("html_document" %in% OutType){AboutMore = '**Table of Contents:** The table of contents at the left side of the document can be used to navigate throughout the document.  When the user selects a section of the table of contents, the subsections will expand to allow for detailed selection of the portion of document that a user wishes to investigate.



**Tables:**  Tables of data can be sorted based on the values in any of their columns.  When a table contains many values, it can be expanded or truncated to show a certain number of rows at a time.  In some cases, tables can be filtered based on the values in their columns.



**Charts:**  Charts can be interacted with in any of the following ways:



- *Filtering* out specific categories by selecting/deselecting those items in the chart legend

- *Hovering* over a chart element to see a description of the data represented

- *Highlighting* a certain portion of a chart to zoom in

- *Saving* a screenshot of a given chart'}else(AboutMore='')
