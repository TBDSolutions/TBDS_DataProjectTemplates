**Purpose:**
To provide an *reference* for **product lifecycle** related processes and practices for the TBD Solutions data science team.  This document is not intended to be "filled-out" like a template; only referenced. See the [Data Science Document Guide](#dsdg) for more on information on data science team documents.

<br>



#Data Science Products:
#### Product = "Medium"
TBD Solutions products are more like "mediums" because they are a way to display information to the customer.  Which medium to select is based on many factors.


<br>

##Determining the best Medium

Use the **DSR_framework** document to learn what the best fit for the client will be based on needs and budget.

<br>

*What is the best data approach and target "meduim"; what do they need to make their decisions?*

<br>

### Commmon Mediums

|        Medium          |  Good fit when...          |   Not a good fit when...         | 
|------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
|Static Report           | Low budget, clear questions|client is unsure what questions they have |
|Interactive RMD report  | Low budget, clear questions|client is unsure what questions they have |
|Flexdashboard           | Medium budget, clear questions,project is projected to continue for at least 1 year|client is unsure what questions they have |
|Shiny Application       | Good Budget, unclear questions, project expected to be open 2+years| low budget, product not expected to be used in any other capacity |



##Product Lifecycle Events{.tabset .tabset-fade}

###New Data Product
Steps to initiate:

1. Create new repository and add the most current templated structural and script items to it
2. 


###Existing Product Update

*(refer to **DSP_data_receipt_governance** for more details on script types)*

<br>

NOTES: wouldn't this process be different for apps with SQL scripts?  need thi consider that?

1. Read application update instructions
    + **Note:** Application specific instructions are located in the #_read_update_odbcflat file(s) (usually there should only be one, but there could be multiple for complicated applications) 
2. Identify data sources
3. Ensure new data has been received for all data sources
4. Update the product by running the following scripts in the repository unless otherwise specifed in the application instructions:
      + read_connect_odbcflat.R
      + app_run.R 
5. Perform testing steps are per the [test section](#testing)
6. Check-in changes to github and create pull-request
7. Deploy product changes to the Shinyapps.io server


###Product Retirement

Basic Considerations:

* Database
* App server deployment
* GitHub Repository



####GitHub Merges:

* Evaluate discprepencies individually
* Meet with broader team or team member when discrepency cannot be easily merged to determine how to combine changes
