**Report Layout:**<n/>
TBD Solutions follows the *CRISP-DM*^[The CRISP-DM process is an iterative methodology that is widely accepted by the data science community.  TBDS follows the [Microsoft Azure proposed methodology](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview).] process for data analysis projects and this report provides a place to document these steps and their outcomes.  This report serves as a framework for the collaborative process of drafting a project charter with TBDS clients.  TBDS follows the project charter methodology proposed by Azure^[The [Azure](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-TDSP-ProjectTemplate/blob/master/Docs/Project/Charter.md) methodology is a framework for collecting background information and documenting project requirements and expected outcomes.].  The project charter is a key part of the *Business Understanding* phase of the *CRISP-DM* process.  

The *Appendix* section of this report contains more detailed information regarding how to use this `r Intractv` report in the [About Document](#about_doc) section.

[comment]: # formatting keeps html andword happy in same template
```{r results='hide'}
OutList <- rmarkdown::all_output_formats(knitr::current_input())
OutType <- OutList[1]
if("html_document" %in% OutType){AboutMore = '**Table of Contents:** The table of contents at the left side of the document can be used to navigate throughout the document.  When the user selects a section of the table of contents, the subsections will expand to allow for detailed selection of the portion of document that a user wishes to investigate.



**Tables:**  Tables of data can be sorted based on the values in any of their columns.  When a table contains many values, it can be expanded or truncated to show a certain number of rows at a time.  In some cases, tables can be filtered based on the values in their columns.



**Charts:**  Charts can be interacted with in any of the following ways:



- *Filtering* out specific categories by selecting/deselecting those items in the chart legend

- *Hovering* over a chart element to see a description of the data represented

- *Highlighting* a certain portion of a chart to zoom in

- *Saving* a screenshot of a given chart'}else(AboutMore='')
