# Business Background

## Client/Business Domain

## What business problems are we trying to address?

---

# Metrics

## What are the qualitative objectives? 

## What are the quantifiable metrics?

## Target Improvement

## What is the baseline (current) value of the metric? 

---

# Output

## How will the analysis be used?

Initial requests from project stakeholders include:

```{r}
tribble(
  ~`As a...`, ~`I want to know...`, ~`So I can...`,
  "",         "",                   "",
  "",         "",                   "",
  "",         "",                   "",
  "",         "",                   ""
) %>%
knitr::kable(caption = "What do stakeholders want from the analysis?")
```

## Scope of analysis/data products:

- What solutions are we trying to build?
- What will we do?
- How is it going to be used by the customer?

---

# Plan

## Define objectives and required output

## Data Acquisition & Understanding

## Modeling, Visualization and Analysis

## Review & Acceptance

## Project Management

# Architecture

## Data Elements

The following data elements are an initial, high-level list of data elements that would be needed to begin constructing the metrics listed above.  Their names do not reflect actual column names or data sources: 

## Data Sources

Data for the above types will be coming from the following sources:

- e.g. Azure SQL Server database
- e.g. Public data repositories

## Data Movement

Data will be copied from on TSA's from on-premises MS Access databases to TBDS' SQL Server using secure FTP or other data movement tools.  

## Tools and data storage/analytics resources

- Filezilla FTP for secure file transfer
- SQL Server 2016 for data storage and querying
- R for data cleaning, feature construction, aggregation and sampling

# Appendix {#app}

## About this Document {#about_doc}

**Approach:**  TBD Solutions follows a version of the *CRISP-DM*^[The CRISP-DM process is an iterative methodology that is widely accepted by the data science community.  This report provides a place to document the various steps and their outcomes.  This report serves as a framework for the collaborative process of drafting a project charter with client organizations.  

**Report Layout:**  Users of this document can interact with any of the data visualizations provided in this supplement.  Below is a list of the primary ways that each of the data displays can be used:

```{r results='hide'}
OutList <- rmarkdown::all_output_formats(knitr::current_input())
OutType <- OutList[1]
if("html_document" %in% OutType){
AboutMore = '**Table of Contents:** The table of contents at the left side of the document can be used to navigate throughout the document.  When the user selects a section of the table of contents, the subsections will expand to allow for detailed selection of the portion of document that a user wishes to investigate.

**Tables:**  Tables of data can be sorted based on the values in any of their columns.  When a table contains many values, it can be expanded or truncated to show a certain number of rows at a time.  In some cases, tables can be filtered based on the values in their columns.

**Charts:**  Charts can be interacted with in any of the following ways:

- *Filtering* out specific categories by selecting/deselecting those items in the chart legend
- *Hovering* over a chart element to see a description of the data represented
- *Highlighting* a certain portion of a chart to zoom in
- *Saving* a screenshot of a given chart'
} else(AboutMore = '')

```
`r AboutMore`
