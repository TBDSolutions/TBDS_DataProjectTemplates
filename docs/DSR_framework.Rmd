**Purpose:**
TBD Solutions follows the *CRISP-DM*^[The CRISP-DM process is an iterative methodology that is widely accepted by the data science community.  TBDS follows the [Microsoft Azure proposed methodology](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview).] process for data analysis projects and this report provides a place to document these steps and their outcomes.  This report focuses on the *Data Understanding* phase of the process.

**Report Layout:**
The *Appendix* section of this report contains more detailed information regarding how to use this `r Intractv` report in the [About Document](#about_doc) section. See the [Data Dictionary](#data_dict) section of this report for a full list of variables and descriptions.

#Executive Summary

##Outputs
```{r fas}
# datatable(table, extensions = 'Buttons',
#           options = list(dom = 'Bfrtip',buttons = c('csv', 'excel',  I('colvis')),
#                          columnDefs = list(list(visible=FALSE, targets=0:6))  #check the number vars
#                          )
#           ,rownames= FALSE)
```


#**Data Understanding**

Separate documents exist are created for this process in the *analyses* repository folder using the following methodology:

### Data Acquisition & Understanding

*	Read in data from sources, convert access database tables into SQL Server tables on TBDS server for analysis
*	Data exploration and understanding
*	Complete data quality analysis and review with Project Sponsor and Project Manager


The following data sources will be used to solve the problem outlined above.

## Define the Datasets
| Dataset Name  | Access Process         | Dataset Definition  |  Update Frequency |
|:--------------|:-----------------------|:--------------------|:------------------| 
|               |                        |                     |                   |
|               |                        |                     |                   |
|               |                        |                     |                   |




##Data Quality Notes: 
| Dataset Name  | Quality Notes          | 
|:--------------|:-----------------------| 
|               |                        |                     
|               |                        |                     
|               |                        |


##Data Preparation and Modeling  

The data preparation files and summaries (if needed) are linked and described below:

#### Processed Data
| Processed Dataset Name | Input Dataset(s)             | Data Processing Tools/Scripts | Link to Report |
| ---------------------: | -----------------:           | ----------------------------: | -------------: | 
| Processed Dataset 1    | [Dataset1](clean_data1/link), 
                           [Dataset2](clean_data2/link) | [clean_data1_data2](link3)    | [Processed Dataset 1 Report](link/to/report1)|
| Processed Dataset 2    | [Dataset3](clean_data2/link) | [clean_data3](link4)          | [Processed Dataset 1 Report](link/to/report2)|


##Processed Data Summary - 1
<!--
The **DATAset 1** dataset has `r ncol()` columns and and `r nrow()` rows.  
```{r}
#support for issues/notes below
rm()
```
-->

* Processed Data1 Key Notes
    + Give descriptions of variables (any variables described go in the data dictionary below)


##Processed Data Summary - 2
<!--
The **DATAset 2** dataset has `r ncol()` columns and and `r nrow()` rows.  
```{r}
#support for issues/notes below
rm()
```
-->

* Processed Data2 Key Notes
    + Give descriptions of variables (any variables described go in the data dictionary below)




## Data Dictionary {#data_dict}

The data dictionary provides documentation of feature variables that are important to the analysis and project.

```{r }

#you can pick which method you like :)

#one reason I thought of I like kable maybe instead is that I can read in your dataset and not have to type var names?
datadict <- cbind(names(Theoph),"")
colnames(datadict) <- c("Variable", "Definition")

datadict[1,2] <- "hi there"
knitr::kable(datadict)

#one reason I like tribble is that though I have to type them, I can see them
tribble(
  ~Variable, ~Definition,
  "a",   1,
  "b",   2,
  "c",   3
)


```



# **Appendix** {#app}

##About this Document {#about_doc}

Users of this document can interact with any of the data visualizations provided in this supplement.  Below is a list of the primary ways that each of the data displays can be used:


[comment]: # formatting keeps html andword happy in same template
```{r results='hide'}
OutList <- rmarkdown::all_output_formats(knitr::current_input())
OutType <- OutList[1]
if("html_document" %in% OutType){AboutMore = '**Table of Contents:** The table of contents at the left side of the document can be used to navigate throughout the document.  When the user selects a section of the table of contents, the subsections will expand to allow for detailed selection of the portion of document that a user wishes to investigate.



**Tables:**  Tables of data can be sorted based on the values in any of their columns.  When a table contains many values, it can be expanded or truncated to show a certain number of rows at a time.  In some cases, tables can be filtered based on the values in their columns.



**Charts:**  Charts can be interacted with in any of the following ways:



- *Filtering* out specific categories by selecting/deselecting those items in the chart legend

- *Hovering* over a chart element to see a description of the data represented

- *Highlighting* a certain portion of a chart to zoom in

- *Saving* a screenshot of a given chart'}else(AboutMore='')

```
`r AboutMore`
