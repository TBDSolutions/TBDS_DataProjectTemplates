**Report Layout:**<n/>
TBD Solutions follows the *CRISP-DM*^[The CRISP-DM process is an iterative methodology that is widely accepted by the data science community.  TBDS follows the [Microsoft Azure proposed methodology](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview).] process for data analysis projects and this report provides a place to document these steps and their outcomes.  This report focuses on the *Data Understanding* phase of the process.


The *Appendix* section of this report contains more detailed information regarding how to use this `r Intractv` report in the [About Document](#about_doc) section. See the [Data Dictionary](#data_dict) section of this report for a full list of variables and descriptions.

#**Data Understanding**

[comment]: # copy this from DSR_charter

The following data sources will be used to solve the problem outlined above.

## Define the Datasets
| Dataset Name  | Access Process         | Dataset Definition  |  Update Frequency |
|:--------------|:-----------------------|:--------------------|:------------------| 
|               |                        |                     |                   |
|               |                        |                     |                   |
|               |                        |                     |                   |



##What does the data look like?
```{r}
# What does the data look like?
# ncol()
# nrow()
# nlevels(as.factor())
# nlevels()
```



##Data Quality Notes: 
| Dataset Name  | Quality Notes          | 
|:--------------|:-----------------------| 
|               |                        |                     
|               |                        |                     
|               |                        |


##Data Preparation and Modeling  

Occur in cyle with each other mostly after the **Business Understanding** and **Data Understanding** phases.  Separate documents exist are created for this process in the *analyses* repository folder.


## Data Dictionary {#data_dict}

```{r }

#you can pick which method you like :)

#one reason I thought of I like kable maybe instead is that I can read in your dataset and not have to type var names?
datadict <- cbind(names(Theoph),"")
colnames(datadict) <- c("Variable", "Definition")

datadict[1,2] <- "hi there"
knitr::kable(datadict)

#one reason I like tribble is that though I have to type them, I can see them
tribble(
  ~Variable, ~Definition,
  "a",   1,
  "b",   2,
  "c",   3
)


```



# Appendix {#app .tabset .tabset-fade}

##About this Document {#about_doc}

Users of this document can interact with any of the data visualizations provided in this supplement.  Below is a list of the primary ways that each of the data displays can be used:


[comment]: # formatting keeps html andword happy in same template
```{r results='hide'}
OutList <- rmarkdown::all_output_formats(knitr::current_input())
OutType <- OutList[1]
if("html_document" %in% OutType){AboutMore = '**Table of Contents:** The table of contents at the left side of the document can be used to navigate throughout the document.  When the user selects a section of the table of contents, the subsections will expand to allow for detailed selection of the portion of document that a user wishes to investigate.



**Tables:**  Tables of data can be sorted based on the values in any of their columns.  When a table contains many values, it can be expanded or truncated to show a certain number of rows at a time.  In some cases, tables can be filtered based on the values in their columns.



**Charts:**  Charts can be interacted with in any of the following ways:



- *Filtering* out specific categories by selecting/deselecting those items in the chart legend

- *Hovering* over a chart element to see a description of the data represented

- *Highlighting* a certain portion of a chart to zoom in

- *Saving* a screenshot of a given chart'}else(AboutMore='')

```
