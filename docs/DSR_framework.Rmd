**Purpose:**
TBD Solutions follows the *CRISP-DM*^[The CRISP-DM process is an iterative methodology that is widely accepted by the data science community.  TBDS follows the [Microsoft Azure proposed methodology](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview).] process for data analysis projects and this report provides a place to document these steps and their outcomes.  This report focuses on the *Data Understanding* phase of the process.

**Report Layout:**
The *Appendix* section of this report contains more detailed information regarding how to use this `r Intractv` report in the [About Document](#about_doc) section. See the [Data Dictionary](#data_dict) section of this report for a full list of variables and descriptions.

#**Data Understanding**

Separate documents exist are created for this process in the *analyses* repository folder using the following methodology:

### Data Acquisition & Understanding

*	Read in data from sources, convert access database tables into SQL Server tables on TBDS server for analysis
*	Data exploration and understanding
*	Complete data quality analysis and review with Project Sponsor and Project Manager


The following data sources will be used to solve the problem outlined above.

## Define the Datasets
| Dataset Name  | Access Process         | Dataset Definition  |  Update Frequency |
|:--------------|:-----------------------|:--------------------|:------------------| 
|               |                        |                     |                   |
|               |                        |                     |                   |
|               |                        |                     |                   |



##What does the data look like?
```{r}
# What does the data look like?
# ncol()
# nrow()
# nlevels(as.factor())
# nlevels()
```



##Data Quality Notes: 
| Dataset Name  | Quality Notes          | 
|:--------------|:-----------------------| 
|               |                        |                     
|               |                        |                     
|               |                        |


##Data Preparation and Modeling  

The data preparation files and summaries (if needed) are linked and described below:

#### Processed Data
| Processed Dataset Name | Input Dataset(s)             | Data Processing Tools/Scripts | Link to Report |
| ---------------------: | -----------------:           | ----------------------------: | -------------: | 
| Processed Dataset 1    | [Dataset1](clean_data1/link), 
                           [Dataset2](clean_data2/link) | [clean_data1_data2](link3)    | [Processed Dataset 1 Report](link/to/report1)|
| Processed Dataset 2    | [Dataset3](clean_data2/link) | [clean_data3](link4)          | [Processed Dataset 1 Report](link/to/report2)|


* Processed Data1 summary. <Provide brief summary of the processed data, such as why you want to process data in this way. More detailed information about the processed data should be in the Processed Data1 Report.>
* Processed Data2 summary. <Provide brief summary of the processed data, such as why you want to process data in this way. More detailed information about the processed data should be in the Processed Data2 Report.> 



##Modeling, Visualization and Analysis

The modeling and visualization elements are developed and maintained in the data medium determined in the *project charter*.  The following methodology is applied:

*	Document key variables derived from source dataset (as necessary) in the [data dictionary](#data_dict).
*	Evaluate algorithms or statistical models developed (as necessary)
*	Develop visualizations and additional output, as defined
*	Draft report / output and review with Project Sponsor and Project Manager


## Data Dictionary {#data_dict}

The data dictionary provides documentation of feature variables that are important to the analysis and project.

```{r }

#you can pick which method you like :)

#one reason I thought of I like kable maybe instead is that I can read in your dataset and not have to type var names?
datadict <- cbind(names(Theoph),"")
colnames(datadict) <- c("Variable", "Definition")

datadict[1,2] <- "hi there"
knitr::kable(datadict)

#one reason I like tribble is that though I have to type them, I can see them
tribble(
  ~Variable, ~Definition,
  "a",   1,
  "b",   2,
  "c",   3
)


```

##About this Document {#about_doc}

Users of this document can interact with any of the data visualizations provided in this supplement.  Below is a list of the primary ways that each of the data displays can be used:


[comment]: # formatting keeps html andword happy in same template
```{r results='hide'}
OutList <- rmarkdown::all_output_formats(knitr::current_input())
OutType <- OutList[1]
if("html_document" %in% OutType){AboutMore = '**Table of Contents:** The table of contents at the left side of the document can be used to navigate throughout the document.  When the user selects a section of the table of contents, the subsections will expand to allow for detailed selection of the portion of document that a user wishes to investigate.



**Tables:**  Tables of data can be sorted based on the values in any of their columns.  When a table contains many values, it can be expanded or truncated to show a certain number of rows at a time.  In some cases, tables can be filtered based on the values in their columns.



**Charts:**  Charts can be interacted with in any of the following ways:



- *Filtering* out specific categories by selecting/deselecting those items in the chart legend

- *Hovering* over a chart element to see a description of the data represented

- *Highlighting* a certain portion of a chart to zoom in

- *Saving* a screenshot of a given chart'}else(AboutMore='')

```
`r AboutMore`
