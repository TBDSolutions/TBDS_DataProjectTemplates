**Report Layout:**<n/>
TBD Solutions follows the CRISP-DM process for data analysis projects and this report provides a place to document these steps and their outcomes.  The *Appendix* section of this report contains more detailed information regarding how to use this `r Intractv` report in the [About Document](#about_doc) section.  The [Project Roles ](#ProjectRoles) section of this report for a list of contacts.  The [Action Plan Overview](#actplov) area near the end of this document outlines the high-level project management plan.

# Appendix {#app .tabset .tabset-fade}

##About this Document {#about_doc}

Users of this document can interact with any of the data visualizations provided in this supplement.  Below is a list of the primary ways that each of the data displays can be used:


[comment]: # formatting keeps html andword happy in same template
```{r results='hide'}
OutList <- rmarkdown::all_output_formats(knitr::current_input())
OutType <- OutList[1]
if("html_document" %in% OutType){AboutMore = '**Table of Contents:** The table of contents at the left side of the document can be used to navigate throughout the document.  When the user selects a section of the table of contents, the subsections will expand to allow for detailed selection of the portion of document that a user wishes to investigate.



**Tables:**  Tables of data can be sorted based on the values in any of their columns.  When a table contains many values, it can be expanded or truncated to show a certain number of rows at a time.  In some cases, tables can be filtered based on the values in their columns.



**Charts:**  Charts can be interacted with in any of the following ways:



- *Filtering* out specific categories by selecting/deselecting those items in the chart legend

- *Hovering* over a chart element to see a description of the data represented

- *Highlighting* a certain portion of a chart to zoom in

- *Saving* a screenshot of a given chart'}else(AboutMore='')

```
`r AboutMore`







##Data Preparation and Modeling  
*Occur in cyle with each other mostly after the **Business Understanding** and **Data Understanding** phases




## Data Dictionary {#data_dict}

```{r }

#you can pick which method you like :)

#one reason I thought of I like kable maybe instead is that I can read in your dataset and not have to type var names?
datadict <- cbind(names(Theoph),"")
colnames(datadict) <- c("Variable", "Definition")

datadict[1,2] <- "hi there"
knitr::kable(datadict)

#one reason I like tribble is that though I have to type them, I can see them
tribble(
  ~Variable, ~Definition,
  "a",   1,
  "b",   2,
  "c",   3
)


```



##Target outputs:


*What is the best data approach and target "meduim"; what do they need to make their decisions?*

Notes from client on which will best fit:

###Questions:

*How often will this output be needed? (e.g. once, monthly, yearly?)
*Do you need to see the data in several ways to make your decisions?
*Do you need to be able to filter and drill-in?



###Decision: Output target:
* Which from **DSP_ProductLifecycle** and why?
